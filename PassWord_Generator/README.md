# 🔐 Password Generator Tool & Streamlit Dashboard

## 🎯 Description

This project provides a complete **Password Generator System** written in Python, including:

### 🧩 1. Core Password Generator Module (CLI)

Generates three types of passwords:

* **Random Password** → letters + optional digits + optional symbols
* **Pincode** → numeric-only password
* **Memorable Password** → multiple dictionary words (NLTK corpus)

The module includes a **simple command-line interface (CLI)** where the user selects password type and options interactively.

---

### 🖥️ 2. Streamlit Dashboard

A visual, easy-to-use dashboard for generating passwords with:

* Sliders
* Toggles
* Text inputs
* Automatic password generation

It provides a more user-friendly interface for all three password types.
