# ✂️ Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## 🎯 Description  
A simple and fun **Python Rock-Paper-Scissors game** where a single player competes against the computer.  
The game is played over **3 rounds by default**, and the program keeps track of scores, announcing the winner of each round and the final winner at the end.  

This mini-project demonstrates the use of:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Input validation  
- Loops and conditionals  
- Random choice generation (`random.choice`)  
- Clean and modular Python coding practices
